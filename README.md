# cx-sast-github-badge-demo

This is a trivial demonstration project for the [cx-sast-github-badge](https://github.com/james-bostock-cx/cx-sast-github-badge) project. Here is an example badge:

![Endpoint Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2F0676-54-86-52-173.ngrok-free.app%2Fbadge%2F10&style=plastic)

The easiest way to generate the Markdown for the badge is to use the form on the righthand side of the [shields.io](https://shields.io) page for [Endpoint Badge](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge)s.

Note that the endpoint used in this file is a transient Ngrok endpoint.
